Hi, I'm Tom, a software engineer and [entrepreneur](http://cloudwarmerinc.com)
living in Brooklyn. I own and operate a number of services, including a
hosted store platform named [Limited Run](http://limitedrun.com), a traffic
analysis and alerting service named [Swell](http://heyswell.com), and a download
card service named [Card Included](http://cardincluded.com). I also organize the
[Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com).

Although the majority of my work isn't open source, I do have a few projects on
[GitHub](http://github.com/tsmango).

Aside from writing software, I enjoy spending time with [Napoleon](/napoleon)
and [cooking vegan](http://instagram.com/onehungryvegan).
