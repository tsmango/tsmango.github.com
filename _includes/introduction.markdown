Hi, I'm Tom, a software engineer and entrepreneur living in Vermont.

I'm the Director of Engineering of the Reporting & Filing Group at
[TaxJar](http://taxjar.com), as well as owning and operating a
hosted store platform named [Limited Run](http://limitedrun.com).

Aside from writing software, I enjoy spending time with partner, Marriele,
our two dogs, Rayner & Potato, and [cooking vegan](http://instagram.com/onehungryvegan).
