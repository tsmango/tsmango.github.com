Hi, I'm Tom, and I've been a software engineer, entrepreneur, product person,
and engineering leader for 20 years. I'm passionate about growing empowered
product teams, having empathy for customers, working remotely, and building
sustainable software.

Aside from [work](http://linkedin.com/in/tsmango), I also enjoy spending time
with my partner, Marriele, our two dogs, Rayner & Potato, and in the kitchen,
[cooking vegan food](http://instagram.com/onehungryvegan).
