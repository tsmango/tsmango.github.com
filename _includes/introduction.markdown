Hi, I'm Tom, a software engineer and [entrepreneur](http://cloudwarmerinc.com)
living on Long Island. I own and operate a number of services, including a hosted
store platform named [Limited Run](http://limitedrun.com) and a download card
service named [Card Included](http://cardincluded.com). I also organized the 2012
[Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com).

Although the majority of my work isn't open source, I do have a few projects on
[GitHub](http://github.com/tsmango).

Aside from writing software, I enjoy spending time with my bulldog,
[Napoleon](/napoleon), eating sandwiches and listening to hardcore and punk music.
