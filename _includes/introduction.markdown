Hi, I'm Tom, a software engineer and [entrepreneur](http://cloudwarmerinc.com)
living in Brooklyn. I own and operate a number of services, including a
hosted store platform named [Limited Run](http://limitedrun.com), a traffic
analysis and alerting service named [Swell](http://heyswell.com), and a download
card service named [Card Included](http://cardincluded.com).

Additionally, after four years of organizing the Rails Rumble (now [Ruby Rampage](http://railsrumble.com)),
I co-founded [RumbleX](http://rumblex.com), where we continue to build and run the biggest
online hackathons in the world, including future iterations of the Rails Rumble, Node
Knockout, Angular Attack, and more.

Although the majority of my work isn't open source, I do have a few projects on
[GitHub](http://github.com/tsmango).

Aside from writing software, I enjoy spending time with [Napoleon](/napoleon)
and [cooking vegan](http://instagram.com/onehungryvegan).
