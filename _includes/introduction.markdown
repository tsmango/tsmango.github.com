Hi, I'm Tom, and I've been a software engineer, entrepreneur, and product person
for the last 20 years. I'm passionate about growing empowered product teams, having
empathy for customers, remote work, and building sustainable software.

I'm the Director of Engineering of the Core Workflow Group at
[TaxJar](http://taxjar.com) and the co-founder of a
hosted store platform named [Limited Run](http://limitedrun.com).

Aside from writing software, I enjoy spending time with partner, Marriele,
our two dogs, Rayner & Potato, and [cooking vegan food](http://instagram.com/onehungryvegan).
