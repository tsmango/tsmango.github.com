### My Past Work

	friends check-in nearby.

[Software Engineer @ Gawkk](/projects/gawkk), Sept 2007 &#8594; Dec 2009 (Sold)

* Gawkk automatically aggregates and categorizes video from thousands of 
	websites. Channels of videos can be subscribed to and videos liked by and 
	commented on by your friends will show up in your news feed. This site was 
	sold in early 2010.

	decisions. I was the sole developer before it was sold.

Software Engineer @ Lourdes Industries, June 2001 &#8594; Sept 2007

* Designed and implemented a centralized authentication & role-based access 
	control system. This J2EE web application provides management for users and 
	permissions as well as an API for all other internal applications to use.
* Started development of a thin client J2EE replacement for a legacy Enterprise 
	Resource Planning system. By the time I left, we had successfully moved 
	customer management, quoting, sales orders, engineering and accounts 
	receivable processes onto our J2EE system. When complete, this system will 
	also handle purchasing, production, inventory and accounts payable.
* Developed a J2EE web application in order to manage the relationship between 
	parts and fixtures (shop tools) as well as to provide metrics on supply usage 
	to more efficiently stock the tool room.
* Developed a J2EE web application that enables users to tag material 
	certification documents scanned into a networked scanner as well as search 
	previously scanned documents.

Freelance & Pro Bono Application Development & Design, 2000 &#8594; Present

* Developed a job management system for use by a manufacturing company in 
	offices spread across the country. This Ruby on Rails application helps to 
	move a job internally through the company, from sales, to customer service, 
	to the art department, to purchasing and eventually to billing. Additionally, 
	this system dynamically generates PDFs and emails for jobs to be used for 
	customer billing as well as ordering from vendors, all while tracking vendor 
	costs and customer facing pricing.
* Developed a document management site for Staples Contract Digital Copy 
	Services. This Ruby on Rails application allows clients to upload documents 
	in bulk with a custom, drag and drop Java applet. This system is currently 
	live and supporting more than 4000 clients that upload over 20GB of data a 
	month to 10 locations and has processed over 100,000 documents.
* Developed a specialized web based scheduling application for use in a hospital 
	with multiple clinics, surgical rooms and resource requirements. This Ruby on 
	Rails application also utilized the dojo javascript framework to display 
	appointments in a calendar view.
* Developed a J2EE product management system for an electronics reseller. This 
	system allowed for the import of multiple vendor databases and automatically 
	managed the best vendor for a product based on availability and price as well 
	as the automated export to various external listing services and the client's 
	Yahoo! store.
* Developed a Ruby on Rails application for a local non-profit organization 
	that manages job listings and application submissions for a network of homes 
	that give aid to the developmentally disabled.

	exhibits, classes, events, artist pages and news.
