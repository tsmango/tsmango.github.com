### Work Experience

[TaxJar](http://taxjar.com) - Feb 2017 &#8594; March 2020

Initially hired as a Software Engineer and later promoted to Director of Engineering,
I helped to grow TaxJarâ€™s remote-only culture from 18 to over 160 employees, while
working to set vision and advance our product offering, as well as define and iterate
on engineering and organizational processes.

Notable Achievements:

  * Defined responsibilities for Software Engineers, Engineering Leads, and Engineering Managers.
  * Iterated on hiring plans for Software Engineers and worked to expand from only hiring
    generally, to hiring for specific skill sets with customized plans, when needed.
  * Developed a hiring plan for Engineering Managers, trained and hired from within for one open
    position, and hired externally for a second.
  * Established a Scrum framework to help alleviate growing pains and push toward more sustainable
    development and more predictable timelines and outcomes, while also establishing processes for
    generating, collecting, and reviewing individual and team metrics.
  * Established processes for 1on1s, career development paths, and managed a multi-million
    dollar budget.
  * Established a culture of recurring social calls, architectural and strategy conversations
    for future projects, and team health check-ins across my fully remote teams. This not only
    helped the teams jell better, but helped with newer teammates that had limited remote experience.
  * Established Architeture & Style guides to help improve code quality and productivity and built
    a culture that contributed to the iteration of those guides through thoughtful discussion.
  * Established and implemented plans to pay down architectural and design debt across the products,
    while simultaneously pushing those products forward for customers and teammates.
  * Established a number of cross-organizational processes for managing projects, tracking and
    implementing changes to tax laws across the country, handling escalations for our AutoFile
    service, internally reporting and tracking bugs and feature requests, scaling and rolling out
    automated filing systems, and more.

Positions Held:

* Director of Engineering, Core Workflow (Oct 2019 &#8594; March 2020)

    included the fulfillment of the promise of TaxJar, by also building tools and processes
    to support internal teams.

    augmented with automation, to support our AutoFile product.

[Co-Founder, Software Engineer @ Limited Run, Inc.](http://limitedrun.com) - June 2009 &#8594; Feb 2017

As a co-founder and the sole developer at Limited Run, I'm responsible for all
technical decisions, development, and operations of our services. While still a
part owner, I no longer handle day to day details.

* [Limited Run](/projects/limitedrun) -
	Limited Run is a hosted store platform for artists, labels, designers or anyone
  selling unique products directly to fans. With some of the largest artists
  in the world, Limited Run handles tens of millions in transactions every year.
  In addition to the self-service version, we also customize, host, and manage
  white-labeled versions of our platform.
* [Card Included](/projects/cardincluded) -
	A self-serve download card service that allows bands and labels to easily design
	and print download cards to use at shows, performances, in vinyl, or just to
	carry around with them.
* Swell (Sunsetted) -
	A traffic analysis and alerting service that told you instantly when something
	exciting happened on your site. You could receive alerts for traffic spikes by
	email, text, or phone and know exactly where that traffic originated from.

[Organizer, Co-Founder @ Rails Rumble, RumbleX](http://railsrumble.com) - July 2012 &#8594; Dec 2016

* I rebooted and retooled the Rails Rumble, a 48 hour, distributed hackathon
	for Ruby developers, reaching thousands of developers every year.
* After organizing the Rails Rumble (later called Ruby Rampage) for four years, I co-founded RumbleX,
  where we continued to build and run the biggest online hackathons in the world, including
  the Ruby Rampage, Node Knockout, Angular Attack, and more.

[Software Engineer @ American Physical Society](http://aps.org) - Jan 2013 &#8594; July 2013

* After their migration from more than a hundred separate SVN repositories, into a single Git
  repository, I built a custom deployment pipeline, which included an orchestrating &amp;
  status web service, as well as an integrated CLI. With this system, developers could easily
  deploy updates to grouped micro-services (for example, a front end web application, as well
  as its related backend API service) to the specific sets of discovered servers, running those
  services, by issuing a single command to the CLI.
* Discovered, organized, and documented micro-services spread out across a number of legacy
  servers, and developed a new Chef-based architecture so they could move away from their own
  data centers and into AWS in multiple regions, with a repeatable environment.
* Developed a new staff-facing content management application (front &amp; backend) for writing,
  updating, and featuring content on individual <a href="http://journals.aps.org">APS Journal sites</a>.
* Developed a new user-facing authentication, profile, and settings service (front &amp; backend)
	for use on <a href="http://journals.aps.org">APS Journal sites</a>.

Project Manager, Software Engineer @ August Ventures - Sept 2007 &#8594; Apr 2011

I was hired by a product person and venture capitalist interested in developing a
series of ideas. My responsibilities included product development, configuration &amp;
deployment to AWS, the API, web applications, and managing the development of iPhone
applications by another developer.

* Shout Messenger -
  Shout was a messaging application designed to quickly exchange voice messages
  with your friends. I was involved early on to help plan and shape the product
  requirements and help to kickstart the development of the iPhone application
  and backend API and infrastrucutre.
* [Firefly](/projects/firefly) (Sunsetted) -
  Firefly was a way to see where your friends on Twitter were. You could find your
  friends in the real-world, share your location and photos, and get notified when
  friends checked-in nearby.
* [Gawkk](/projects/gawkk) (Sold) -
  Gawkk automatically aggregated and categorized video from thousands of
  websites. Channels of videos could be subscribed to and videos liked by and
  commented on by your friends would show up in your news feed. This site was
  sold in early 2010.

Software Engineer @ Lourdes Industries, June 2001 &#8594; Sept 2007

  control system. This J2EE web application provides management for users and

	Services. This Ruby on Rails application allows clients to upload documents
	in bulk with a custom, drag and drop Java applet. This system is currently

	month to 10 locations and has processed over 150,000 documents.
