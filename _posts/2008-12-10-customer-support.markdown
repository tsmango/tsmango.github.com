A few days ago, I ordered a pair of snowboard pants from [The House](http://www.the-house.com). When they showed up last night they were the wrong size. Further investigation revealed that the drop down containing sizes on their website listed them wrong. The size I selected was not the size they thought I ordered.

Luckily, The House has great customer support. I called the toll free number and a woman answered immediately. No automated menus. She answered, I said I was sent the wrong size, she transferred me to the right person.

The person who I was transferred to helped me find a different pair of pants. Discounted them. Ensured they would ship the same day and gave me free shipping on them. In the box will be the return shipping labels for the pants that were the wrong size so that I won't have to pay shipping to send those back.

There was only one painful part of the experience. The on hold music was just a single song on loop. [James Brown's "I Feel Good"](http://www.gawkk.com/james-brown-i-feel-good-http-leplubo-nn-cx-video-izle-indir-download/discuss).
