Earlier today, a company named [Sqoot](http://sqoot.com) posted about a **Boston API Jam** event of theirs.

The event details, [which can be seen on Eventbrite](http://apijam-boston.eventbrite.com) (**Update:** it looks like this event is no longer on Eventbrite, there is a link to a screenshot of the event further down), currently include a "Great Perks" section:

> * Massages: Take a break from hacking to unwind.
> * Live DJ: Let great beats get you in the groove.
> * Gym Access: Grab a free pass and run across the street to the Boston Sports Club for a quick work out.
> * Food Trucks: Clover, Kick Ass Cupcakes, Lobsta Love, Staff Meal, & Cupcakory. Don't like those options? Grab a $10 LevelUp credit and try something different.
> * Top Shelf Booze: Choose from a selection of great imported beer or sip on a speciality cocktail.
> * Hosts: Need another beer? Let one of our friendly event staff hosts get that for you.
> * 5-hr Energy: By our math, you'll need at least 4 to get you through the weekend.
> * Perfect Fuel: Dark chocolate for a healthy & active life! More.

The problem is that when they [first posted](http://cl.ly/0K3y1b1i1V251h3J190u) it<sup id="fnr-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, rather than the current "Hosts" *perk*, it was actually "Women" and read:

> * Women: Need another beer? Let one of our friendly (female) event staff get that for you.

The Internet got mad. Really mad. Shortly thereafter, sponsors like [Heroku](http://twitter.com/heroku/status/182188114876440577), [CloudMine](http://twitter.com/cloudmine/status/182195164738093056) & [Apigee](http://twitter.com/Apigee/status/182184261846183936) pulled out of the event.

As we unfortunately see this kind of thing time and time again, you know what happened next. Sqoot issued an apology - a bullshit apology:

> While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment
> poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically
> male-dominated, others were offended. That was not our
> intention and thus we changed it.
>
> We’re really sorry,
>
> Avand & Mo

As far as apologies go, this is as run-of-the-mill, out-of-the-PR-damage-control-handbook as they come. They aren't sorry about what they're doing or what they said, they're sorry that people were **offended** by what they said.

Everyone flipped (and rightly so) about the blatant sexist "perk" and Sqoot seemingly apologized for what they wrote. They tweeted a link to that "apology" (originally written in Google Docs). They replied to hundreds people on twitter with a [stock "We're sorry (link)" tweet](http://cl.ly/1z1z0h15400P3r1H2t1p). They updated the Eventbrite page to remove the sexist wording.

But what has that changed? Absolutely nothing. They clearly designed this event in a specific way: massages, a live dj, "top shelf booze", and a female event staff. Simply changing the wording on their marking page to say that "hosts" will serve you beer while you hack away doesn't change how the event was designed. The exact same motivation is behind it, they just made the event's description easier to digest.

Sqoot took the easy way out. They fucked up and then they responded to people being offended about what they wrote, rather than responding to what people should actually be offended about: what they're going to do at their event.

**Update:** Sqoot has since replaced the two sentence apology they posted to Google Documents with an expanded apology on [their blog](http://blog.sqoot.com/we-can-do-better-an-apology-from-sqoot).

In their updated apology, they state:

> While we aimed to call attention to the male-dominated tech world through humor and intended to be inclusive, the gravity of our wording was just the opposite.

So originally listing "Women" as a perk of their event, in their eyes, was an intentional move to "call attention to the male-dominated tech world". Is anyone buying this?

Towards the end of their updated apology, they state:

> As we decide whether to continue with the event, or reschedule for another time, we will focus efforts on making sure that our event marketing is inclusive to all. We will do better.

Again, if they can muster up new sponsors to help pay for everything, they don't plan to change the event itself. From where they sit, it was their marketing that was flawed.
