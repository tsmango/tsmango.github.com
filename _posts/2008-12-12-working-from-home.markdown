It's incredible how much you can get done when working from home. Before I went full time at Gawkk over a year ago, I had a software engineering job at a regular company. I was in an office. People would call all day. People would stop by. I had to physically go to meetings. It really affected productivity.

When I started working from home, I thought that it would be tough.

I mean, it's what everyone was telling me.

> "You're going to work from home? Wow, I could never do that. I'd never get anything done!"

But really, what distractions are there? You don't have to stop what you're working on to make it to a meeting. You don't have to answer the phone calls from people who don't want to wait for a response from an email. You also don't have people dropping by to just shoot the breeze.

Once you realize that 9 to 5 isn't when you have to be productive. Everything else falls into place. Sure, I like to generally be at my desk before 9 and I try and remember to pull myself away after 5 (although I can get sucked into my code), but if I was up late the night before and feel better starting at 10, it's not that big of a deal. The key is working when you are productive. There is no sense at sitting at your desk doing nothing from 9 to 10 if on that particular morning you feel like crap. Work when you are productive and the distraction-less environment will help facilitate that.

It probably also helps if you actually enjoy doing what you do.
