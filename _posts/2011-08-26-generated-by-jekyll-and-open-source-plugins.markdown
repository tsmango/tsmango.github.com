title: "Generated by Jekyll &amp; Open Source Plugins"
---

I've spent my free time over the past week replacing my existing site with this new, [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) generated site and I couldn't be happier with how it came out. Jekyll, written by GitHub's [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo), is an extremely extendible static site generator. While developing my new site, which is hosted in an S3 bucket on Amazon, I ended up implementing a couple of simple plugins that I've opened sourced in hopes that others may find them useful. If you'd like to see the entire source of this site, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tsmango/thomasmango.com) and if you'd like to learn more about my plugins, keep reading.

### AliasGenerator

This generator looks through the YAML Front Matter of each post and generates redirect pages when an `alias` configuration is set. I found this plugin necessary when migrating my existing posts on tumblr to a more sane url structure.

Example Configuration:

<script src='https://gist.github.com/1174145.js?file=example-configuration.html'> </script>
<noscript>
<div class='code-snippet'>
<pre><code>---
  layout: post
  title: &quot;How I Keep Limited Pressing Running&quot;
  alias: /post/6301645915/how-i-keep-limited-pressing-running/index.html
---</code></pre>
</div>
</noscript>

This alias is set on my ["How I Keep Limited Pressing Running"](http://thomasmango.com/2011/06/07/how-i-keep-limited-pressing-running/) article which was originally published at tumblr and will redirect anyone going to the old address.

### FlickrSetTag

This tag generates a simple image gallery from a set of photos on Flickr.

Example Usage:

<script src='https://gist.github.com/1174155.js?file=example-usage.html'> </script>

This will result in a bit of generated html displaying thumbnails of each photo in the set. Check the repository's `README` for configuration details.

### More About Plugins

Although there are a decent amount of [plugins already available](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins) for Jekyll, like me, you may not find the exact plugin to suit your needs. Luckily, Jekyll makes it pretty straightforward to write your own. I highly suggest picking out a few interesting plugins and reading through the source and understanding how they work.
