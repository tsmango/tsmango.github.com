In early 2007, I was contracted to implement a document management web application for Staples Digital Copy Services. Customers can register and upload documents for very large jobs to Staples' regional copy centers. The app handles documents for about ten locations. The only non-rails part was a multi-file uploader I wrote as a Java applet. Staples wanted drag and drop file uploading that also supported dropping multiple files at once, which I was able to do with Java.

Certain privileged Staples employees can log in and download documents, read descriptions and manage which jobs have been completed.

I was contacted a few days ago for a quote to work on a new feature for the application and was happy to see the app has been running smoothly these past few years. They keep adding locations to the system and it's quickly closing in on managing 100,000 documents.
