title: "Conference Culture &amp; Codes of Conduct"
---

I'm not very involved in the development community. The extent of my involvement and support includes a bit of [open source work](http://github.com/tsmango), when time permits, buying books written by authors in the community, paying for services built by people in the community, and running the [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com).

My lack of involvement is not restricted to the development community, though. I'm a really private person. I keep to myself in all aspects of my life. And by this, I mean that I have what I can only describe as crushing social anxiety that I've chosen to be okay with, rather than figure out a way to change.

Because I keep to myself, I don't often hear about some of the [terrible things happening](http://blogjustine.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/because-it-needs-to-be-said/).

I find this entire incident described by Justine appalling. Everything about it. The entire chain of events. What I've written here isn't about the incident Justine described, but it was prompted by what she wrote and the disgusting comments that followed her post.

Conference Culture
------------------

A lot of Justine's post showed the culture of drinking at meetups and tech conferences. If you rewind to the part above where I said how I keep to myself, you can probably guess that I don't really attend conferences, or am very social, or drink. That's not to say I never consume alcohol. I will have a beer while out to dinner a couple of times a year. But I don't "drink". I don't drink to drink. I don't drink to get drunk. I don't go to bars. That just isn't me.

As for tech conferences, a few months ago I decided I'd try and attend a couple. My first conferences, aside from a single day trip into the city for Gotham Ruby 2008, were [Burlington Ruby](http://burlingtonruby.com) in August, and [Nickel City Ruby](http://nickelcityruby.com) in September.

The conference experience wasn't what I expected, or I guess, not what I had hoped for.

Perhaps naively, I went for the talks. I went to learn and to become a better developer. Some of the talks were indeed technical, and I really enjoyed those. And some of the other non-technical talks were interesting too, although not what I had specifically gone for. But I didn't go to network, or meet people, or socialize. So after going to these two conferences, I came to realize that most tech conferences these days are probably not for me. It seemed like people expected, and got, a lot more from the other things surrounding the conference, than just from the content of the talks themselves. People like to network and meet new people in their field, and while this is perfectly okay and understandable, it wasn't what I personally hoped to get from attending.

I'm still interested in going to conferences and learning, and I suspect there exist conferences more suited to me, but now I know what to look for, I suppose.

Codes of Conduct
----------------

Both conferences had scheduled networking events. Coffee in the morning. Drinking at night. Crushing anxiety and general disinterest in socializing, I pointedly avoided these things. Put me in a room with a few people I know, and I'm okay. Put me in a room with a hundred complete strangers and okay just please don't put me in a room with a hundred complete strangers. But one thing I **was** exposed to at each conference, was a Code of Conduct. And each time, sitting in the audience, I found it completely bizarre. I found myself thinking that I couldn't believe this was necessary. Okay, maybe some of the people attending were five or ten years younger than I, but still, they're adults, aren't they? Why do they need to be reminded to "Be Considerate", "Be Respectful", and "Be Professional"?

And then I read Justine's post and the comments.

While I don't think having a Code of Conduct would have prevented the events she described from unfolding as they did, I think the point about drinking at conferences is important here. Maybe the way these events are planned are just too out of hand in many cases. Maybe the focus for these conferences have shifted from learning to socializing. And I suppose that maybe this, in turn, means having a Code of Conduct is particularly important. Maybe conferences were never really about learning and I just don't understand that. But also, maybe we need alternative conferences that focus more on learning, for people that are interested in that sort of thing.

To be clear, the conference Justine described wasn't specifically a Ruby conference and as for the two conferences I attended, I have no idea what happened after 5pm at either of them, because I wasn't there to find out. I suspect everything went fine and people had fun.

Rails Rumble
------------

So how does this relate to the Rails Rumble? Well, this year's rumble is happening next week. And since the Rails Rumble isn't like a regular conference or hackathon, in that it isn't physically held at a specific location, it never had a Code of Conduct. And just as I sat in those two conferences earlier this year, thinking that having a Code of Conduct was truly bizarre, and being amazed that such a thing was necessary, I also never thought to add one after rebooting the rumble last year. But when it comes down to it, the Rails Rumble is about people. Thousands of people are what make the Rails Rumble happen.

Participants may not all be in a single physical place during the competition, but after reading the comments on Justine's post &mdash; or really anywhere on the internet &mdash; it's impossible to ignore that people can be terrible, not just in person, but online. We have open comments on every entry's page on the Rails Rumble site, and we have an official #railsrumble channel on IRC that people hang out in.

While I haven't seen anyone being uncivil or unprofessional in the past, I think we can still take a page from conference organizers and, at the very least, remind people how they are expected to act, with an [Official Code of Conduct](http://railsrumble.com/conduct).
