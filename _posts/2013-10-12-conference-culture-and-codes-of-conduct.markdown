title: "Conference Culture &amp; Codes of Conduct"
---

I'm not very involved in the Ruby community, or the development community at large, for that matter. The extent of my involvement and support includes a bit of [open source work](http://github.com/tsmango), when time permits, buying books written by authors in the community, paying for services built by people in the community, and running the [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com).

My lack of involvement is not restricted to the Ruby community, though. I'm a really private person. I keep to myself in all aspects of my life. And by this, I mean that I have what I can only describe as crushing social anxiety that I've chosen to be okay with, rather than figure out a way to change.

Because I keep to myself, I don't often hear about [terrible things in the community](http://blogjustine.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/because-it-needs-to-be-said/).

I find this entire incident described by Justine appalling. Everything about it. And while this post isn't about the incident Justine described, it was prompted by what she described and the disgusting comments that followed.

Conference Culture
------------------

In Justine's post, she commented briefly about the culture of drinking at meetups and conferences. About how it's essentially too rampant. If you rewind to the part above where I said how I keep to myself, you can probably guess that I don't really attend conferences, or am very social, or drink. That's not to say I don't enjoy a single beer while out to dinner, two or three times a year, because I do. But I don't "drink". I don't drink to drink. I don't drink to get drunk. I don't go to bars. That just isn't me.

As for conferences, a few months ago I decided I'd try and attend a couple. My first conferences, aside from a single day trip into the city for Gotham Ruby 2008, were [Burlington Ruby](http://burlingtonruby.com) in August, and [Nickel City Ruby](http://nickelcityruby.com) in September.

The conference experience wasn't what I expected, or I guess, not what I had hoped for.

Perhaps naively, I went for the talks. I went to learn and to become a better developer. Some of the talks were indeed technical, and I really enjoyed those. And some of the other non-technical talks were interesting too, although not what I had specifically gone for. But I didn't go to network, or meet people, or socialize. And after going to these two conferences, I came to realize that most conferences are probably not for me. It seemed like people expected, and got, a lot more from the other things surrounding the conference, than just from the content of the talks themselves. While this is perfectly okay and understandable, it wasn't what I personally hoped to get from them.

I'm still interested in going to conferences and learning, and I suspect there exist conferences more suited to me, but now I know what to look for, I suppose.

Codes of Conduct
----------------

Both conferences had scheduled networking events. Coffee in the morning. Drinking at night. Crushing anxiety and general disinterest in socializing, I pointedly avoided these things. Put me in a room with a few people I know, and I'm okay. Put me in a room with a hundred complete strangers and okay just please don't put me in a room with a hundred complete strangers. But one thing I **was** exposed to at each conference, was a Code of Conduct. And each time, sitting in the audience, I found it completely bizarre. I found myself thinking that I couldn't believe this was necessary. Okay, maybe some of the people attending where five or ten years younger than I, but still, they're adults, aren't they? Why do they need to be reminded to "Be Considerate", "Be Respectful", and "Be Professional"?

And then I read Justine's post.

While I don't necessarily think having a Code of Conduct would have prevented the events she described from unfolding as they did, I think the point about drinking at conferences is important here. Maybe it's too out of hand in many cases. Maybe the focus for these conferences have shifted from learning to socializing. Maybe this, in turn, means having a Code of Conduct is particularly important. Maybe they were never about learning and I just don't understand that. But also, maybe we need alternative conferences, that focus more on learning, for people that are interested in that sort of thing.

To be clear, I have no idea what happened after 5pm at the two conferences I attended, because I wasn't there to find out. I suspect everything went fine and people had a good time.

Rails Rumble
------------

This year's Rails Rumble is happening next week. And since the Rails Rumble isn't like a regular conference, in that it isn't physically held at a specific location, it never had a Code of Conduct. And just as I sat in those two conferences earlier this year, thinking that having a Code of Conduct was truly bizarre, and being amazed that such a thing was necessary, I also never thought to add one after rebooting the rumble last year. But when it comes down to it, the Rails Rumble is about people. People, thousands of them, are what make the Rails Rumble happen.

Participants may not all be in a single physical place during the competition, but after reading the comments on Justine's post or really anywhere on the internet, it's impossible to ignore that people can be terrible, not just in person, but online. We have open comments on every entry's page on the Rails Rumble site, and we have an official #railsrumble channel on IRC that people hang out in. In the past, I never saw anyone being uncivil or unprofessional, but I think we could still take a page from conference organizers and, at the very least, remind people how they are expected to act, with an [Official Code of Conduct](http://railsrumble.com/conduct).
