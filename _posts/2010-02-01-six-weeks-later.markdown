I spent the past six weeks working full time on [Limited Pressing](http://limitedpressing.com) and I'm really happy with what was accomplished. We teamed up with some big names to host charity auctions (as of this writing we've raised almost $15,000 that will be donated to Doctors Without Borders) and rolled out a lot of new features. The biggest feature we launched was our brand new [Stores](http://limitedpressing.com/stores) infrastructure that I think makes it incredibly easy (not to mention inexpensive) to get a site and store up and running for your label or band.

Aside from software work, I was also able to get my feet wet over at Amazon with things like EC2 and RDS. Although there were a lot of new things I wanted to spend time learning that got overlooked, I hope to rectify that in the coming weeks.

Starting today, I begin a brand new project with [Gary Culliss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Culliss) that I'm really looking forward to working on.
