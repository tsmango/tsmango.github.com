PGnJ is a database development environment for Mac OS X. Unlike clients that
came before it, PGnJ's unique, single window interface gives you everything
you need, right at your fingertips.

Development for this project started in 2004 and continued for nearly four
years. Version 1.0 was released in December of 2008 and a few minor
improvements were released in 2009.

### Important Support Related Notes

* I highly recommend [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) for MySQL users,
  which has embraced the single window design seen in PGnJ since early 2004.
  It's full featured, looks great, and is extremely stable.
* For PostgreSQL, I absolutely recommend [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).
  It's a modern Mac app approach to database clients, built specifically for
  PostgreSQL, with continuing active development.
* While PGnJ does run on OS X Yosemite, it still looks and feels like it did
  back in 2008. And because of Java's continually diminishing support on OS X,
  PGnJ may simply stop working one day.

### Features

* Support for major databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and SQLite.
* Query Editor with syntax highlighting, error suggestion and sql templates.
* Table Data Editor that supports out of the box pagination and custom sql
	where and order by clauses.
* One of a kind QuickJoin feature that lets you simply join columns in from
	associated tables while browsing your data in the Table Data Editor. It's
	pretty great.
* Fully keyboard navigable interface. Jump between views, execute queries,
	load scripts, navigate database objects and inspect column details all from
	the comfort of your keyboard.
* Store sql scripts in the Script Library for future use. Scripts even support
	:variables that can be set before execution.
* Executed queries are stored in the history browser. See them all at once or
	step through one by one right from the Query Editor.
* A powerful one window interface, flexible data exports and many more features.
