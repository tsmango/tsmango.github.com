Seymore is an open source content management system built on the Rails

functions are available throughout the site so users are able to contextually 
and comfortably manage their content throughout their website.

### Features

* Contextual content management
* Pretty URLs
* Automatic page revision tracking
* Publishing workflow
* Non-destructive rollbacks
* Add pages at any level
* Drag and drop page reordering at any level
